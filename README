# Construction Supply E-Commerce Starter

A Django-powered starter site for a family-owned construction supply store. It includes a customer-friendly catalog with ordering, real-time stock tracking, and a simple inventory dashboard.

## Features
- Product catalog with descriptions, pricing, and live stock badges.
- Quick order form that automatically reserves inventory and prevents overselling.
- Inventory dashboard to add or edit products without leaving the site.
- Google Maps link so customers can get directions to the physical store.
- Django admin for deeper management and reporting.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Apply migrations and create a superuser for the admin dashboard:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8000` for the storefront or `http://localhost:8000/admin` for admin tools.

## Production notes
- Set `DEBUG=0` and configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` plus a secure `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
- Serve static files from `staticfiles/` using a web server or CDN.
- Add HTTPS and caching at the edge for faster, safer performance.
